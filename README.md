# Academic Forecasting System
## Overview
This software is designed to forecast student performance based on various factors such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, and Test preparation course. The goal is to understand how these variables influence test scores. The software follows the typical life cycle of a machine learning project, starting from understanding the problem statement to choosing the best model.

1. Problem Statement
The project aims to analyze and predict student performance in exams by considering external factors such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, and Test preparation course.

2. Data Collection
Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: Students Performance in Exams. It consists of 8 columns and 1000 rows.

Life Cycle of Machine Learning Project
1. Understanding the Problem Statement
Understand the objective of predicting student performance and the factors influencing it.

2. Data Collection
Collect data from the provided Kaggle dataset, which includes variables like Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, and Test preparation course.

3. Data Checks to Perform
Perform data checks to identify missing values, outliers, or any anomalies in the dataset.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis to gain insights into the relationships between variables.

5. Data Pre-Processing
Clean and pre-process the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

6. Model Training
Train machine learning models on the pre-processed data to predict student performance based on the specified variables.

7. Choose Best Model
Evaluate the performance of different models and choose the one that best fits the problem statement.
